# Tree Traversals
Unlike data structures like arrays, linked lists, queues, which only have
one logical method of traversing them, a tree can be traversed in different
ways. First we have depth first traversals, which include preorder, inorder,
and postorder traversals. Then we have a breadth-first traversal, which is called
a level order traversal.

This part of the respository will cover both.
